                    <h2>Introduction to Lean Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>Lean manufacturing represents a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste while maximizing customer value in production processes. Originally developed by Toyota, these principles have been successfully adapted across various industries, including backpack manufacturing, where efficiency, quality, and cost control are paramount.</p>

                    <p>In the competitive backpack industry, manufacturers face pressure to reduce costs, improve quality, shorten lead times, and respond quickly to market demands. Lean manufacturing provides a framework for achieving these objectives through systematic waste elimination, continuous improvement, and employee empowerment.</p>

                    <h2>Core Principles of Lean Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>Lean manufacturing is built on five fundamental principles that guide decision-making and process improvement efforts. Understanding and implementing these principles is essential for successful lean transformation in backpack production.</p>
